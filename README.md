# Gamebot-Competition
This repository holds the starter API for the GameBot Competition being held at NaSCon '18, FAST-NUCES Islamabad, Pakistan.

### Prequisites/Dependencies

* Operating System: Windows 7 or above (64-bit)

* The Python API is made in version 3.6.3 and tested only for this version but it should run on any version above 3. For running it in Python versions below 3, some slight changes are required. Probably you would be able to figure them out yourselves but you can always contact the event head for your problem resolution.

* Java API is made and tested in JDK 10 but it should also work with other versions.

* Download and install the pre-requisites for the BizHawk emulator from this [link](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk-Prereqs/releases/download/2.1/bizhawk_prereqs_v2.1.zip).
